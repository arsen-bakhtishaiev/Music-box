# Music-box
Simple DY-SV8F board-based music box.

3xAAA batteries are used to power the circuit, the voltage is converted to 5V using a boost converter. 

You would need 8xM4 brass inserts and 8xM4 10mm screws to assemble the box.

The case was designed in Freecad, you would need to export the files into 3MF files and print them. Clean 3MF files without printer settings could be added later.
I've printed it with PETG, 15% infill, it was enough to withstand a very curious 2-year-old. Tree supports are used to ensure holes on the side are printed properly.
Any battery case that can hold 3xAAA batteries would work, although I've designed and printed a holder myself to keep the costs down(which, in the end, was not the best idea).
All the boards are hot-glued to the bottom, this worked out to be much more reliable than screws.
The hole on the side is for the 32x22 mm switch that turns the damn thing off, the holes on top are for momentary switches with 28mm outer diameter.

Created by an amateur clown.
Note that I have no idea what I am doing.
