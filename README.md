# Music-box
Simple DY-SV8F board-based music box.
3*AAA batteries are used to power the circuit, the voltage is converted to 5V using a boost converter. 
You would need 8*M4 brass inserts and 8*M4 10mm screws to assemble the box.

Created by an amateur clown.
Note that I have no idea what I am doing.
